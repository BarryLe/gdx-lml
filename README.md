## Gdx Autumn MVC examples
See [gdx-autumn-mvc](http://github.com/czyzby/gdx-autumn-mvc).

Available example projects:
- `gdx-idle`: the first, a bit rusty example of a clicker game made with Autumn MVC. Some code (especially logic-related) was rushed and I never managed to force myself into correcting it.
- `simple`: a simple application using VisUI. Supports desktop, GWT and Android.
