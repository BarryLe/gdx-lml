#LibGDX Markup Language
Templates for LibGDX Scene2D with HTML-like syntax and FreeMarker-inspired macros.

##Sample project
Coming soon, in a separate repository. I don't want to include samples before the library can be obtained from Maven Central and the projects could actually compile without manual dependency attachments.

##Maven artifact
Coming soon.

##Documentation
See [LibGDX forum thread](http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=18843).
