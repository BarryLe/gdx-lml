# Simple

A simple application built with [Autumn MVC](https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-lml/tree/master/mvc) and VisUI (thanks to [gdx-lml-vis](https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-lml/tree/master/lml-vis)). Nothing fancy, just some view examples - it's not an actual game, it's just supposed to make it easier to set up Autumn MVC applications.

This application will show you some basics of Autumn MVC:
- Preparing a configuration component.
- Creating UI with LML, actor injection.
- Screen transitions, dialogs.
- Music themes, using sounds, managing settings.
- Simple asset management.
- Locale changing.

Launch like any other LibGDX application. Note that it does not come packed with Gradle, so make sure to install it yourself.
