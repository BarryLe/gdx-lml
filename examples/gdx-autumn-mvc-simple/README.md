#Simple

A simple application built with Autumn MVC and VisUI (through `gdx-lml-vis`). Nothing fancy, just some view examples - it's not even an actual game, it's just supposed to make it easier to set up Autumn MVC applications.

This application will show you some basics of Autumn MVC:
- Preparing a configuration component.
- Creating UI with LML, actor injection.
- Screen transitions, dialogs.
- Music themes, using sounds, managing settings.
- Simple asset management.
- Locale changing.

Launch like any other LibGDX application.
