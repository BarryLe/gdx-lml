It uses a simple, custom UI skin defined at `core/assets/skin.json`. The design is (somewhat) based on the great `VisUI` library, but obviously not as complex or polished. It has pre-defined styles for all default `Scene2D` actors, so it can be useful for quick prototyping - if you want to use these assets in your project, feel free to do so. You can modify raw skin assets at `core/raw` and run `gradle pack` task to recreate the atlas file with your changes.
